📌 Overview
This project uses machine learning to predict laptop prices based on their specifications. It helps buyers estimate a fair price for a laptop and sellers optimize their pricing strategies.

🔹 Tech Stack:
Python
Streamlit (for the web app)
Scikit-Learn (for machine learning)
NumPy & Pandas (for data processing)
🚀 Features
✔ Predicts laptop prices based on specifications
✔ Uses Random Forest Regressor for accurate predictions
✔ Implements feature engineering (e.g., calculating Pixels Per Inch)
✔ Interactive Streamlit web app for real-time predictions
